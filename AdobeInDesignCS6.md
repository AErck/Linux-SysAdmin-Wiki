# How to use Adobe InDesign CS6

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Document

When creating a new document you can select what the inteded medium will be for the document, either **Print**, **Web**, or **DigitalPublication**. This will automatically use color settings appropriate for the medium you chose. For example, choosing **Print** will set colors to use **CYMK** so colors display closer to what they will look like when printed by a convetional printer.
Next we choose a page size. A drop down menu is available containing some presets to choose from, such as **Letter** and **A4**. The **Height** and **Width** boxes display the points or pixles of the chose preset. These boxes can accept other units of measure, for example you could enter `8.5 in` and it would set the **Height/Width** to the appropriate values.
