# How to use Adobe InDesign CS6

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Document

When creating a new document you can select what the intended medium will be for the document, either **Print**, **Web**, or **DigitalPublication**. This will automatically use color settings appropriate for the medium you chose. For example, choosing **Print** will set colors to use **CYMK** so colors display closer to what they will look like when printed by a conventional printer.

The page options are listed next. Here you can designate the number of starting pages you want. It is okay to start with only one if you do not know how many you will need later. Second we have the starting page number, which designates which page will be labeled number one. Facing pages will make pages pair up like in a book. This ios a great option if your pages will be near eachother or are part of a booklet.

Next we choose a page size. A drop down menu is available containing some presets to choose from, such as **Letter** and **A4**. The **Height** and **Width** boxes display the points or pixels of the chose preset. These boxes can accept other units of measure, for example you could enter `8.5 in` and it would set the **Height/Width** to the appropriate values.

The **Columns** section is where you can specify the number of columns you want on your document. A good example of this would be a trifold document like a brochure. If you specify more than one column, a *gutter* space will be added between the columns, which can be modified with the *Gutter* box. Like **Height/Width** this box can accept other units of measure. The gutter provides a blank space for the fold of a brochure for example. On the document, the coulmns and gutter will be outlined in a pink/purple line for your visual reference. This lines will **not** be printed or displayed in the final format.

The **Margins** section controls the margins of the document. Margins are especially important for print applications, or items that will need to be cut. Like the columns and gutter, the margins are denoted by the pink/purple lines around the edge of the document. It is best to keep images and text inside of the margins to prevent obvious errors in printing and cutting of printed documents. By default, the margins are linked by the "Chain" icon. You delink the margins by clicking this buttom, typically this is not recommended.

The **Bleed and Slug** section works similar to margins. This for expanding graphics and colors beyond the bounds of the document so it can be printed on a bigger sheet of material and then be cut down to the specified size. This allows for images and colors on the edge of the document, and leaves room for cutting errors. The **Slug** holds meta-data for the printers (human printers that is) about what colors where used and so forth.

### Working in Your Document

The first major change with this software compared to msot other software is the `File --> Place` option. This is used to insert graphics instead of `File --> Open` or `File --> Import` which you would see in other software. As you might expect, InDesign supports native Photoshop and Adobe Illistrator image files.

When you select your image and click `Open` on the Place window, you will move back to the document with a cursor and thumbnail of the image. Tap on the mouse once to place the image at full size. Otherwise, click and drag to add the image at a size you want.

Images are **NOT** part of the InDesign document, they are just linked to the document. Be mindful of this if you are moving the file to another filesystem.
