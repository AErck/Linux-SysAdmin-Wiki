# How to use Adobe InDesign CS6

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Document

When creating a new document you can select what the intended medium will be for the document, either **Print**, **Web**, or **DigitalPublication**. This will automatically use color settings appropriate for the medium you chose. For example, choosing **Print** will set colors to use **CYMK** so colors display closer to what they will look like when printed by a conventional printer.

Next we choose a page size. A drop down menu is available containing some presets to choose from, such as **Letter** and **A4**. The **Height** and **Width** boxes display the points or pixels of the chose preset. These boxes can accept other units of measure, for example you could enter `8.5 in` and it would set the **Height/Width** to the appropriate values.

The **Columns** section is where you can specify the number of columns you want on your document. A good example of this would be a trifold document like a brochure. If you specify more than one column, a *gutter* space will be added between the columns. This can be modified with the *Gutter* box. Like **Height/Width** this box can accept other units of measure.
